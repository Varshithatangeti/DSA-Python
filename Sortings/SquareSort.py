# The given code defines a class `Solution` with a method `sortedSquares` that processes a list of integers as follows:  

# - **Squaring Elements:** It iterates through the list and replaces each element with its square.  
# - **Sorting the Squared Values:** It uses a nested loop (bubble sort) to sort the squared values in ascending order.  
# - **Returning the Result:** The sorted list of squared values is returned.  

# This approach has a **time complexity of O(nÂ²)** due to the inefficient sorting method. A more optimal approach would be to use built-in sorting (`sorted(nums)`) or a two-pointer technique (**O(n log n) or O(n)** complexity).
